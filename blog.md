The COVID-19 outbreak has slowed some of my client work for the week, so I decided to start and complete a side project over the next 5 days. I set out a few ground rules:

- No working outside of regular work hours (for me 11-6)
- Must deploy something by the end of the week
- Must publish this post by the end of the week
